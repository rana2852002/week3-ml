# Contributing

This repo is designed to be a **portfolio-quality** submission.

## Ground rules
- Keep changes small and reviewable.
- Prefer clear code over clever code.
- Add/adjust tests when you change behavior.
- Run formatting + tests before pushing.

## Commands
- Run tests: `uv run pytest`
- Format: `uv run ruff format .`
- Lint: `uv run ruff check .`

> If you don't have `uv`, you can use a regular virtualenv and `pip install -e .[dev]`.
